def countdown
end

def countdown_with_sleep
end


Write a method that takes in an integer argument and uses a while loop to countdown from that
integer to 1, outputting "#{number} SECOND(S)!" in each iteration of the loop. The method
should return "HAPPY NEW YEAR!" after the loop finishes. 
Hint: In Ruby, a method will return the very last line of code that it executes.
